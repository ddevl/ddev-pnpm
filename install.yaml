# list of files and directories listed that are copied into project .ddev directory
# Each file should contain #ddev-generated so it can be replaced by a later `ddev add-on get`
# if it hasn't been modified by the user.
# DDEV environment variables can be interpolated into these filenames
# If you use directories, they must be directories that are managed
# by this add-on, or removal could remove things that are not owned by it
project_files:
  - commands/web/pnpm
  - web-build/Dockerfile.pnpm

# Version constraint for DDEV that will be validated against the running DDEV executable
# and prevent add-on from being installed if it doesn't validate.
# See https://github.com/Masterminds/semver#checking-version-constraints for constraint rules.
# Available with DDEV v1.23.4+, and works only for DDEV v1.23.4+ binaries

# Shell actions that can be done during removal of the add-on.
# Files listed in project_files section will be automatically removed here if they contain #ddev-generated line.
# removal_actions are executed in the context of the target project's .ddev directory.
